# Q: How to Run `.sh` Files on Raspberry Pi

## why we have `.sh`?

Installing dependenices and libreries on Raspberry Pi can be a bit challenging, so we prepare `.sh` as much as possible to reduce the struggleing users with errors while instaling the files/libreries.

## What is a `.sh` file?

A `.sh` file is a **shell script** ‚Äî a text file that contains a list of terminal commands. It‚Äôs often used to automate tasks like installing software or setting up your Raspberry Pi.

---

## How do I run a `.sh` file?

Follow these simple steps to run a `.sh` file on your Raspberry Pi:

### 1. Open the Terminal
Click the Terminal icon on your Raspberry Pi (it looks like a black screen with a `>_` symbol).

### 2. Navigate to the Folder
Use the `cd` command to change to the folder where your `.sh` file is located. Example:

```bash
cd Downloads
```

### 3. Make the Script Executable (only needed once)
Before running the script, give it permission to execute:

```bash
chmod +x yourscript.sh
```

Replace yourscript.sh with the name of your file.

### 4. Run the Script

```bash
./yourscript.sh
```

## Tips
Make sure the file ends in .sh

Always include ./ before the filename when running it

Read any error messages carefully ‚Äî they usually help you understand what's missing or needs fixing




# Q: What is a virtual environment (venv) in Python?

A virtual environment is a **self-contained directory** that holds a specific Python version and any libraries or dependencies your project needs. It keeps your project isolated from other Python projects and from the system-wide Python installation.

---

## Q: Why are virtual environments important?

Here are a few reasons:

- ‚úÖ **Avoid Conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same package. `venv` keeps them separate.
- üîí **Safe Testing**: You can test libraries or code changes without affecting your main system.
- üì¶ **Clean Dependency Management**: All dependencies for your project are kept in one place.
- üöÄ **Professional Standard**: Most modern Python workflows use virtual environments.

---

## Q: How do I create a virtual environment?

In your terminal, navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This will create a folder named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

---

## Q: How do I activate the virtual environment?

### On Raspberry Pi or Linux/macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On Windows (Command Prompt):

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Q: How do I know it's activated?

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change and show the name of the environment like this:

```bash
(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/myproject $
```

---

## Q: How do I deactivate it?

To leave the virtual environment, just type:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## Q: How do I reactivate the virtual environment later?

Just run the activation command again from your project folder:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Q: What if I forget to activate it?

If you install packages without activating your virtual environment, they might be installed globally or in the wrong location. Always activate `venv` first before running or installing anything in your project.

---

## Bonus Tip: Install Packages in venv

After activating:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

All packages will be installed only inside the virtual environment.

Stay organized and safe with `venv`! üêçüõ°Ô∏è


# Q: Why start using virtual environments then not use one in lesson 4
Initially, we introduced the virtual environment because it's a best practice for managing project dependencies and avoiding conflicts across different Python projects. However, during the project, we encountered a specific technical limitation: The Pi Camera libraries depend on system-level resources and hardware interfaces that aren't always accessible from inside a Python virtual environment. Because virtual environments are isolated, they sometimes can't see or interact with low-level system components ‚Äî like the camera ‚Äî which are needed for these libraries to work. That's why we had to run the project outside the venv.

Because of this, we had to run the code outside the virtual environment to access the camera successfully. This is a common real-world scenario where sometimes the ideal setup (like using a virtual environment) has to be adjusted due to hardware or system constraints.

Even though we didn‚Äôt use the virtual environment in the final project, understanding how and why to use one is still valuable for future projects, especially those that don‚Äôt involve hardware dependencies.
