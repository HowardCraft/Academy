## üì¶ Dataset

You can collect your images or download it from sources:

 we use in this lesson: https://universe.roboflow.com/cuenta-2/platanos-jxxqb/dataset/7

You need to Download yolo11 version




##  Train
Run install_yolo_dependencies.sh, this bash file will run all required libraies.
 `sudo ./install_yolo_dependencies.sh`

source yolo11_env/bin/activate 
python3 train_yolo.py provide code to train


## Test


  *You can put your images in samples directory and run this code- you need to replace your file name with **image.jpg**:
    `./ObjectDetectionYours.sh $(pwd)/test.jpg`
